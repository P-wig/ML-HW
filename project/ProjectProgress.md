# SUBMISSION FORMAT FOR THE REPORTS

#  Predicting Housing Prices
**Isaac Shepherd** 

## Project Summary

<Complete for *Project Proposal* assignment submission to give idea to the reader what youre trying to do and how> 

The purpose of the Predicting Housing Prices project is to develope a machine learning model that is capable of estimating the sale prices of houses based on various features such as location and size demographics. The main objective of this project is to train a predictive model based on real estate data, to accurately and effectively estimate the 
prices of future house listings.

<Fully rewrite the summary as the last step for the *Project Submission* assignment: github.com repositories on how people shortblurb the project. It is a stand alone section. It is written to give the reader a summary of your work. Be sure to specific, yet brief.>


## Problem Statement 

<Add one sentence for the *Project Proposal* assignment submission that captures the project statement.>

The Predicting Housing Prices project aims to develope a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the sale prices of houses with regards to varying factors such as location and size, as to provide insight for future home buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

<Expand the section with few sentences for the *Project Progress* assignment submission> 
* Give a clear and complete statement of the problem.
* What is the benchmark you are using.  Why?  
* Where does the data come from, what are its characteristics? Include informal success measures (e.g. accuracy on cross-validated data, without specifying ROC or precision/recall etc) that you planned to use. 
* What do you hope to achieve?>

The grand total of an estate's value is compiled with a multitude of factors centered around size, location, and ammenities. The problem I am solving is a way to estamate a median price point for a house in a multitude of locations, with a multitude of variation between house ammenities.

the benchmarks I am using to train my learning model are square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, acre lot, and zip code location.

The data was retrieved from a recently updated kaggle library. the characteristics of the data are again, brokered_by, status, price, bed, bath, acre_lot, street, city, state, zip_code, house_size, and prev_sold_date. I plan to train the model to accurately predict the relative price of a house given the vital contributing factors data. I hope that my model is able to accurately fit the training data, and make predictions with a low margine of error.

<Finalize for the *Project Submission* assignment submission> 

## Dataset 

<Add highlights on the dataset, specifically the size in instances and attributes for **Project Proposal**>

My dataset from Zillow provides a Region Name, State, Metro, County Name, Size Rank, and the median housing price of each month from 1996 to 2016. Pruning the older data and the Nan values I will be able to train a predictive model that will account for regional variations and trends in the housing market over time.

<Complete the following for the **Project Progress**>
* Description of the dataset (dimensions, names of variables with their description) If in doubt, use 3.1-3.3. [Datasheets For Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) as a guideline.  
* If you are using benchmarks, describe the data in details. If you are collecting data, describe why, how, data format, volume, labeling, etc.>

The dimensions of the raw data was 2226382 rows by 12 columns. After preprocessing the dataset is reduced to 1360627 by 6.
brokered_by = encoded value for agency the brokered the house
status = boolean value for sold or for_sale
price = float value used as the experiments target value
bed = integer attribute for number of bedrooms
bath = integer attribute for number of bathrooms
acre_lot = double value to indicate the squared area in acres the house resides
street = encoded value for street location
city = string value to label what city the house resides
state = string value to label what state the house resides
zip_code = numerical label for house location
house_size = float value to indicate square footage of the house
prev_sold_date = data value of when house was sold

* What Processing Tools have you used.  Why?  Add final images from jupyter notebook. Use questions from 3.4 of the [Datasheets For Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) paper for a guide.>  

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

<Complete for **Project Progress**>
* What EDA graphs you are planning to use? 
* Why? - Add figures if any

I have generated a pairplot to visualize relationships between variables, and several scatterplots for PCA and t-SNE to visualizes my preprocessed data in reduced dimensions

* Describe the methods you explored (usually algorithms, or data wrangling approaches). 
  * Include images. 
* Justify methods for feature normalization selection and the modeling approach you are planning to use. 

## Data Preprocessing 

<Complete for *Project Progress*>
* Have you considered Dimensionality Reduction or Scaling? 
  * If yes, include steps here.  
* What did you consider but *not* use? Why? 

I have considered both dimensionality reduction and scaling in my experiment, and utilized a Standard Scaler, and PCA and t-SNE dimensionality redicing mechanisms.

## Machine Learning Approaches

<Complete for **Project Progress**>

* What is your baseline evaluation setup? Why? 
* Describe the ML methods that you consider using and what is the reason for their choice? 
   * What is the family of machine learning algorithms you are using and why?

I am still evaluating baseline learning models, all I have acomplished pretains to preprocessing and data evaluation on variable relations and dimensionality. I an considering using a dataset balancing tool such as RandomOverSampler or SMOTE to to improve the relative performance of my model after I have done dry tests on the imbalanced dataset. I have considered using ensemble machine learning algorithms as they yield the most robust fits for multidimensional data.

<Expand and complete for **Project Submission**>

* Describe the methods/datasets (you can have unscaled, selected, scaled version, multiple data farmes) that you ended up using for modeling. 

* Justify the selection of machine learning tools you have used
  * How they informed the next steps? 
* Make sure to include at least twp models: (1) baseline model, and (2) improvement model(s).  
   * The baseline model  is typically the simplest model that's applicable to that data problem, something we have learned in the class. 
   * Improvement model(s) are available on Kaggle challenge site, and you can research github.com and papers with code for approaches.  

## Experiments 

< **Project Progress** should include experiments you have completed thus far.>

I have not yet touched on any models as I want more input on my provided data plots so I may take more educated steps in selecting a strong model to fit my data.

<**Project Submission** should only contain final version of the experiments. Please use visualizations whenever possible.>
* Describe how did you evaluate your solution 
  * What evaluation metrics did you use? 
* Describe a baseline model. 
  * How much did your model outperform the baseline?
